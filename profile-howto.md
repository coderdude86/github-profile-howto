# How-to create a Profile Page


### Steps:
1. In the upper-right corner of any page, use the + drop-down menu, and select New repository.
2. Under "Repository name" type a repository name that matches your GitHub username. For example, if your username is "JasonMckeeBakosKenzie", the repository name must be "JasonMckeeBakosKenzie". (A box will pop up saying you found a secret!)
3. Optionally, you can add a description of your repository. For example, "My personal repository."
4. Make the repository public
5. Initialize the repository with a README
6. Click the green Create Repository button
7. On the right side of the page, above the right sidebar, click Edit README
8. At this point create markdown to be displayed on your profile page! It is pre-populated with some ideas on what to add inside a comment.
